## Introduction
It was observed that there is a robust community of swing traders and day traders on Twitter. A subset of these traders have built up a large following on the social media platform as a result of giving good recommendations on which stocks to buy and sell. The majority of the recommendations posted by these traders are volatile small cap and microcap stocks commonly referred to as "penny stocks".
Given that there are many different day traders with a large following on Twitter and each day trader discusses multiple different stocks simultaneously, the process of determining which equities to invest in was a time consuming task. Additionally, once an equity was purchased, it would need to be closely monitored for movements in price-- a process that consumed more time, and was subject to human factors (fear and greed). 

It was determined that in order to successfully operate in this area of equities, implementing a system with the following features would be necessary.  
  + Remove the human factors involved in trading these volatile equities.  
  + Remove the human factors involved in evaluating these equities.  
  + Greatly increase the volume of equities evaluated.
